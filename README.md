Background
Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and production company. Launched
on August 29, 1997, it offers a library of films and television series through licensing deals and
in-house production.
Each week, Netflix publishes its top 10 titles, along with how many hours users spent watching
each one. These are split up into four categories: Films (English), Films (Non-English), TV
(English), and TV (Non-English). Investors have a number of key questions about Netflix that
this data can help address. For example: Is Netflix producing and licensing engaging content?
Are Netflix's content investments in new genres or geographies generating significant
viewership? How is viewership trending over time, and what implications does this have for
Netflix's subscriber numbers?
To answer these questions, we scrape the Netflix top 10 website every week. We run our
systems on a set schedule, assuming that Netflix will continue to publish the list each week. We
then scrape IMDb to get information including a movie or showâ€™s running time and ratings. Once
we have this data, we clean and analyze it to provide insights to our clients.
